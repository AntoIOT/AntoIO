## Anto client library for ESP8266-Arduino
### This branch is a development on adopting Paho MQTT as a core library for MQTT

###### TODO ######
- Reconnect procedure in the `AntoIO::mqtt.loop()` function
- Other callback functions (OnPublished, OnDisconnected, OnConnected)
- Make this library available in File -> Examples in Arduino IDE
- Request via HTTPS
